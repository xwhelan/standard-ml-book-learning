# Standard ML Book Learning

I learn well by having a book on one side of the screen, and a lightweight IDE and/or terminal on the other side. It takes a lot of effort to write and publish a book, so I get a more coherent and focused approach than tutorials or noodling around. On the other hand, you learn *about* things by reading, not how to do things, so running and testin gin parallel makes sure it sticks.

This is not the only way I learn, but the way I'm doing it here.

## Why Standard ML?

[Hindley-Milner type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)
are a thing I talk about without really knowing or understanding. I want to fix that by going back to the source - the ML language family. I think that to understand where we are (like with Haskell or Scala) we must understand how we got here. Just like how I had to get at least some C to understand why networking, and Python, are the way they are.

This also opens up new approaches and paths to me, because any discussion of the JVM versus .NET Core will bring up Hindley-Milner... and that Fâ™¯ is to OCaml as PowerShell is to Perl.
