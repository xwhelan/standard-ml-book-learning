Source text: [chapter2.pdf](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/MLbook/PDF/chapter2.pdf)

Declarations of a variable are of form `val pi = 3.14159 : real;` and terminated with a semicolon.

Declare functions with declaration `fun ...` and try to annotate:

```smlnj

val pi = 3.14159 : real;

fun area r =  (* area of circle with radius r *)
    pi * r * r;

```

Binding is lexically scoped. You can redefine but won't affect eslewhere

## Exercise 2.1

Read declarations from a file with `use "myfile"`. See [exercises.sml](exercises.sml)
